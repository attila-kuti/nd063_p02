"CHANGE made: Number of EC2 instances were moved down (maximized) in 240 -> might be improper estimate to meet the user requirements. Possibly higher response times, more CPU usage, EVEN higher costs because of different CPU credit usage! (max 40% CPU usage was planned with 450 instances..)",,,,,,,,
