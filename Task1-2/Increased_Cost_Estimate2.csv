CHANGE made: ,"Number of EC2 instances increased to 600 to reduce response times, reduce CPU usage.",,,,,,,
CHANGE made: ,"Number of READ replicas increased from 1 to 9 (distributed to both AZ-s) -> better performance, higher availability. ",,,,,,,
CHANGE made: ,Increased server size t3.large -> t3.xlarge (even larger would be fit to budget). Exact requirement details are unknown. Real load testing would help.,,,,,,,
CHANGE made: ,BACKUP storage has been added too!,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
QUESTION:,NOT clear if Tx burstable instances and CPU credits may or may not be used by Reservation and/or upfront payments?! Costs could be considerably reduced by them.,,,,,,,
